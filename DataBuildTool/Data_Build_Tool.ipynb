    "- DBT (data build tool) __enables analytics engineers to transform data in their warehouses by simply writing SELECT statements__. \n",
    "- In Extract Load & Transform (ELT) process, dbt transform data - `T`. https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/elt\n",

    ">### Transform\n",
    ">In the final transformation step, the raw data that has been loaded into your data warehouse is finally ready for modeling! When you first look at this data, you may notice a few things about it…\n",
    "\n",
    ">- Column names may or may not be clear\n",
    ">- Some columns are potentially the incorrect data type\n",
    ">- Tables are not joined to other tables\n",
    ">- Timestamps may be in the incorrect timezone for your reporting\n",
    ">- JSON fields may need to be unnested\n",
    ">- Tables may be missing primary keys\n",
    ">- And more!\n",
    "...hence the need for transformation! During the transformation process, data from your data sources is usually:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Lightly Transformed: Fields are cast correctly, timestamp fields’ timezones are made uniform, tables and fields are renamed appropriately, and more.\n",
    "Heavily Transformed: Business logic is added, appropriate materializations are established, data is joined together, etc.\n",
    "QA’d: Data is tested according to business standards. In this step, data teams may ensure primary keys are unique, model relations match-up, column values are appropriate, and more.\n",
    "Common ways to transform your data include leveraging modern technologies such as dbt, writing custom SQL scripts that are automated by a scheduler, utilizing stored procedures, and more.\n"
